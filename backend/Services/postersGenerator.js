You are a senior marketing designer and brand strategist.
Your task is to create advertising posters that are not only visually strong,
but also strategically persuasive and conversion-oriented.


Create THREE high-quality, marketing-ready advertising posters for the business below.
The posters should be visually striking, emotionally engaging, and ready for real-world publication.

Do not repeat the same layout or visual structure across the three posters.
Each poster must feel like a different campaign direction.


Business Name: "${businessName}"
Business Description: "${businessDescription}"
Brand Essence: "${essence}"
Target Audience: "${targetAudience}"
Tone of Voice: "${tone}"
Main Tagline: "${tagline}"

Visual Style: "${visualStyle}"
Extended Design Style: ${extendedStyle}
Color Palette: ${colors?.join(", ")}

Core Design Instructions:
- The posters must clearly represent the business and its identity.
- The business name must be visible and readable in each poster.
- The business name text color must be selected strictly from the provided color palette.
- Use the color palette intentionally: background, typography, and graphic elements should feel cohesive and branded.
- The main tagline must be the dominant visual element and immediately grab attention.
- The design should communicate professionalism, credibility, and emotional appeal.

Poster Variations:
Poster 1 – Typography-Focused Concept:
- The tagline is the main visual element.
- Strong typographic composition.
- Minimal or no imagery.
- Clean, bold, high-contrast layout.

Poster 2 – Visual-Driven Concept:
- One powerful central image or illustration related to the business field.
- Text supports the visual emotionally, not descriptively.
- Atmospheric, cinematic, or immersive feeling.

Poster 3 – Conceptual / Graphic Concept:
- Abstract or symbolic interpretation of the brand essence.
- Use shapes, lines, or color blocks derived from the palette.
- More expressive and artistic while remaining clear and professional.

Additional Requirements:
- Avoid clutter and unnecessary text.
- Maintain strong visual hierarchy and readability.
- Designs must feel intentional, premium, and advertising-focused.
- Each poster should feel like a distinct creative direction.
- The result should look like professional brand campaign material, not an illustration or mockup.


Design Requirements:
- The poster must communicate ONE clear central message.
- Strong visual hierarchy: 
  1. Main tagline (large, bold, immediate attention)
  2. Supporting visual or subtle secondary text (optional)
  3. Business name / logo placement (clean, not overpowering)
- Use strong color contrast for maximum readability and impact.
- Clean, modern, professional composition.
- Avoid clutter, excessive text, or unnecessary decorative elements.
- The design should feel intentional, premium, and emotionally engaging.
- The poster should instantly appeal to the target audience within 3 seconds.

Typography:
- Bold, legible, expressive typography.
- Typography may act as a visual element itself.
- No generic fonts.

Imagery:
- Use a single strong visual concept OR a typographic-led design.
- The visual should support the message emotionally, not explain it literally.

Branding:
- Integrate the logo subtly and professionally.
- The logo must not dominate the poster.


Output:
- Three distinct advertising poster designs
- High-resolution
- Ready for print and digital advertising
